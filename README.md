# Flink Sandbox

This is a sandbox repo for learning and playing with Flink, and ultimately comparing its capabilities against Quine. The repo is a multi-project scala repo so that multiple Flink jobs can be created here and assembled into JARs.

## Projects

- `fraud-detection-example`: This is the Fraud Detection example from Flink's documentation
- `count-example`: This is an example project that defines a custom source, sink, and process function. Serves as a super simple reference for making a more complicated job.
